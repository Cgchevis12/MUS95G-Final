## Describe Raga in as much detail as you can. 

Indian classical music uses ragas, a melodic framework, for both composition and improvisation.
A Raga has its own set of notes (swaras), which make up the melodic structure, and its own set of guidelines for movements
that are both ascending and descending (aaroha and avroha). In order to define the mood and feeling of the Raga, each Raga
also contains a dominant note (vadi) and a secondary note (samvadi). Ragas can elicit feelings such as joy, grief, love,
or devotion. They are frequently connected with certain times of day, seasons, or moods.
